## What is Grade Calculator?

Grade Calculator is a quick and accurate way to calculate the current grade you have and also allows users to input hypothetical grades. 

The inspiration behind this is from Canvas. Canvas has a system where professors can input the weights of certain grade categories and the grades are automatically calculated as points are added in those respetive categories, but the problem is, not every professor uses it! Because of this, I thought it would be effective to make my own grade calculator based on my needs.
